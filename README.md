# Alarm Clock with Gradual Sunrise Simulator

An STM32 powered alarm clock with a system of blue LEDs activated to gradually wake the user in the morning, leading to less tiredness than with a simple alarm.

This project features the usage of many STM32 peripherals, including:
- PWM for controlling the brightness of the LEDs over time
- RTC to accurately track the passage of time
- System interrupts to handle the user input through the buttons

At the moment, the only file included is the main.cpp file. Soon, I will add the rest of the STM32 project files in order to allow for easy usage and more thorough documentation.
